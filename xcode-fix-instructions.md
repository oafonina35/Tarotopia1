# Fix Xcode Opening Wrong Project

## The Problem
Xcode opened a new SwiftUI project instead of your Capacitor-React Tarotopia app.

## Solution: Open the Correct Project

### Step 1: Close Current Xcode Project
- Close the current ContentView.swift project in Xcode

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Tarotopia Project
In Terminal on your Mac, go to your Tarotopia project folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/tarotopia-project
ls -la  # You should see: ios/, client/, server/, package.json
```

### Step 3: Build and Sync First
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the React app
npm run build

# Sync with Capacitor iOS
npx cap sync ios

# Open the CORRECT iOS project
npx cap open ios
```

### Step 4: Verify Correct Project
When Xcode opens, you should see:
- **Project name**: "App" (not "Tarotopia")
- **Files**: No ContentView.swift, but instead:
  - App folder with AppDelegate.swift
  - public folder with your React build
  - Capacitor plugins

### Step 5: Alternative Manual Opening
If `npx cap open ios` doesn't work:

```bash
# Navigate to the iOS project
cd ios/App

# Open the Xcode project file directly
open App.xcodeproj
```

OR double-click on `ios/App/App.xcodeproj` in Finder

## What You Should See in Correct Project
- **Bundle Identifier**: com.tarotopia.app
- **Main files**: AppDelegate.swift, not ContentView.swift
- **Public folder**: Contains your built React app
- **Capacitor**: Plugins for camera, filesystem, etc.

## If It Still Opens Wrong Project
Your Tarotopia files might not have transferred correctly. You need:
1. The `ios/` folder from your Replit project
2. All React app files in `client/`
3. `package.json` with all Capacitor dependencies
4. `capacitor.config.ts` with Bundle ID: com.tarotopia.app

## Test the Correct Project
Once you have the right project open:
1. Select iPhone simulator
2. Click the Play button ▶️
3. Your Tarotopia app should launch showing the mystical interface, not a "Hello World" SwiftUI view
