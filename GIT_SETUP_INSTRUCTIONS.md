# Git Setup Instructions for iOS Development

## Current Status
Your Tarotopia project is ready for iOS development and App Store deployment. The git repository needs to be properly initialized and committed.

## Manual Git Setup Required

Due to git lock files, you'll need to manually run these commands:

### 1. Clear any git locks:
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
rm -f .git/config.lock
```

### 2. Initialize and commit your project:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Tarotopia iOS-ready version"
```

### 3. Optional: Add remote repository:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/tarotopia.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Project Structure for iOS

Your project is now optimized for iOS development with:

✅ **Updated .gitignore** with iOS/Xcode specific exclusions
✅ **Capacitor configuration** ready for iOS build
✅ **iOS folder** with Xcode project files
✅ **Clean codebase** with unused files removed
✅ **Production-ready** Tarotopia app

## Files Ready for iOS Development

- `ios/App/` - Complete Xcode project
- `capacitor.config.ts` - Capacitor configuration
- `package.json` - All dependencies included
- `client/` - React frontend optimized
- `server/` - Node.js backend
- `shared/` - Shared types and schemas

## Next Steps

1. Run the manual git commands above
2. Open `ios/App/App.xcworkspace` in Xcode
3. Build and test on iOS Simulator
4. Submit to App Store when ready

Your app is fully functional and deployment-ready!
